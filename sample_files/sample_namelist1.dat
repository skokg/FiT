# Input file type. 1=fortran binary file, 2=netcdf file, 3=CSV ASCII file 
# To able to use the NetCDF files the software has to be compiled with the NetCDF support
# Netcdf files have to have the same structure (dimension names, variable name, ...)
# as the sample netcdf files in "sample_files" folder.
# The newline characters and empty lines are ignored in the CSV files. For the structure  
# of the CSV file, please look at the sample CSV files in the "sample_files" folder.
# The sequence of values in CSV files changes fastest with the x dimension, then the y dimension, and then the z dimension.

# The location with file prefix for input files. The files should have the 
# filenames input_file_prefixCCCC.dat (Fortran file) or input_file_prefixCCCCC.nc 
# (netcdf file) or input_file_prefixCCCCC.csv (CSV ascii file). CCCCC is the counter with five digits which starts at 00000.
# On a Linux system using the bash shell, the following command can usually be used to create CCCCC.dat  
# links to a sequence of files with different filenames located in the same folder:
# a=0;for i in $(ls); do new=$(printf "%05d.dat" ${a});  ln -sf ${i} ${new};   let a=a+1; done

# The number of cascading thresholds to be used. The regions with values below the lowest 
# threshold should have a value of 0 in the input field. The regions with values between 
# the lowest threshold and the next higher threshold should have the value 1, and so on 
# to the highest threshold. The areas with values higher than the highest threshold should 
# have a value equal to number_of_thresholds
# If number_of_thresholds=1, only one threshold is used (no cascading thresholds). 
# If a value greater than number_of_thresholds is found in the input field, the software 
# stops with an error message.

# The horizontal distance limit for merging 3D objects into 4D objects. A value of -1 disables the limit. 
# If a positive value is used, the merging of each individual 3D object into a multi-piece 4D object 
# is only performed if the distance between the centers of the 4D object and the 3D object 
# is smaller than the prescribed value. The value represents the horizontal Euclidian 
# distance in x and y dimensions (distance in z dimension is ignored) expressed with the number of 
# grid points (e.g., a value of 200 represents the distance of 200 gridpoints).
